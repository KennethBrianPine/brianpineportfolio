          I am Kenneth Brian Pine, a 4th-year IT student at Adamson University. I have skills in designing user-friendly apps and managing projects.
          I worked on the 'AdU Foundit' mobile app as a designer, programmer, and writer. I also used Adobe XD to make app designs and helped with project documents.
          I hosted TechnoSummit 4.0, which improved my speaking and leadership skills. I am good at solving problems, working with others, adjusting to changes, and accepting feedback.

      <h1>My On-the-Job Training Experience</h1>
      
          <p> I started my On-the-Job Training (OJT) on February 24, 2025, at OTis Philippines. On my first day, I felt nervous and overwhelmed because I was in a new place with new people. I was scared to ask questions at first because I thought I might get scolded. But I was wrong. My OJT supervisor and the HR manager were very kind and easy to talk to. They answered all my questions and made me feel welcome and comfortable.
            </p>
            <p>
                I quickly noticed that the workplace is very different from school. One big difference is time. I had to work for eight hours a day, five days a week, which was a big change from my usual school schedule. Another difference is the kind of tasks. In school, we have set subjects and schedules, but at work, it depends on what the supervisor needs us to do. Some days are busy, and some days are lighter.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my first two weeks, I had a hard time adjusting. Everything was new, and I didnâ€™t know how to use some of the tools. When I got my first task, I didnâ€™t know where to start or how to find the resources I needed. I solved this by searching on Google and watching YouTube tutorials. These helped me understand what to do and complete my task. We also had weekly meetings every Monday with our OJT supervisor. He would ask how we were doing, if we were still enjoying the training, and if we had any problems. He also checked our progress, which helped us stay on track.
            </p>
            <p>
                I faced a few challenges during my OJT, like adjusting to a new environment, being afraid to make mistakes, and not knowing how to start some tasks. Working long hours was also new to me, and it was hard to stay focused sometimes. But I slowly became more confident. I started asking more questions, talking to my teammates, and using online resources to help me. I also made a habit of taking notes and organizing my tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                From this experience, I learned that it's okay to ask for help, that being prepared and organized really helps, and that stepping out of your comfort zone is important for growth. I also learned how to manage my time and be more responsible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our last project was to create our own portfolio website. I enjoyed making it, but it was also a bit hard. It was difficult to decide on my personal style, choose the right color palette, design the layout, and think about what content to include. Still, I managed to finish it and felt proud of the result. This website will be very useful in the future when applying for jobs or showing my work to clients. Itâ€™s a good way to present my skills and experiences in a professional way.
            </p>
            <p>
                My On-the-Job Training was not just a school requirement, but also one of the best experiences Iâ€™ve ever had. What I really liked about working at OTis Philippines is the work-life balance. As long as we finish our tasks on time, weâ€™re allowed a bit of free time to relax or take a short break. This helped me stay focused and avoid burnout. My colleagues were also very friendly and helpful. They were approachable, accommodating, and always willing to lend a hand when I needed help. They were great team players and made the work environment feel positive and supportive. It was nice to be part of a team that values respect and cooperation. I truly appreciate all the guidance and lessons they taught usâ€”it was a big help throughout our OJT.
